They have showed nothing but professionalism and courtesy during my most recent (and previous) stay. Any reasonable request was accommodated. Any questions were answered proficiently. I appreciate the service they provide. The room was kept up by housekeeping and not a pillow out of place. \n\nI will return to the Hotel Indigo, if anything to just have the politeness and professionalism of the staff.", "trip_type": "BUSINESS", "rating": 5, "author_id": "A86C61DEC98B1624B9EE5D960182BD92"}

Ring around the bathtub.  1 towel for a double room. The sink was no better.  The floors in the bathroom had paint stains.  The phone did not work. There were no cups for coffee or juice for breakfast.   Some drank juice from a cereal bowl. The view outside of our room was old mattresses on the ground.  It was one step up from crack house.  If it wouldn't have been 1 am, I would have asked for my money back and left.  Very disappointed after staying at other locations for several years without incident.", "trip_type": "FRIENDS", "rating": 1, "author_id": "A86C61DEC98B1624B9EE5D960182BD92"}

It was a nice quiet hotel where we could relax before a 14 hr flight home. \n\nThe rooms were clean and spacious although it is an older hotel. The breakfast was included and plenty of variety for adults and children. \n\nThe staff were excellent, nothing was too much hassle. \n\nHighly recommended for a night before flying.", "trip_type": "FAMILY", "rating": 4, "author_id": "A86C8F01766AAD9193124D41D04F2F51"}
